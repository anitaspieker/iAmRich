# About the original app
I Am Rich was an iOS mobile application developed by Armin Heinrich that was distributed through the App Store. When launched, the screen contained only a glowing red gem and an icon that, when pressed, displayed the following mantra in large text:

I am rich         
I deserve it         
I am good,         
healthy & successful         

The application is described as "a work of art with no hidden function at all", with its only purpose being to show other people that they were able to afford it. I Am Rich was sold on the App Store for US$999.99, €799.99, and £599.99, the highest price Apple allowed for App Store content. The application was removed from the App Store without explanation by Apple Inc. the day after its release, August 6, 2008.
